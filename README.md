## IGCommentPicker

Quick Instagram comment scraper I put together

Makes GET requests to an Instagram post's GraphQL endpoint. Done this way rather through Facebook Graph API because it allows for more than 150 query results at one time and doesn't require the user to login.

Built using Next.js, React, axios, Formik/Yup
